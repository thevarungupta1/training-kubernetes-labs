# Lab 05: Understanding of Services

## **Objective**
By the end of this lab, you will have a functional Minikube installation running on a Windows machine, allowing you to deploy and manage Kubernetes clusters locally.

### **Services in Kubernetes**
A **Service** in Kubernetes is an abstraction that provides network access to a set of pods. Since pods are ephemeral and can be replaced, their IP addresses can change. A Service ensures that communication with a group of pods remains stable, even as individual pod instances come and go.

---

## **Key Features of a Service**
1. **Stable Network Endpoint**  
   - Services provide a single IP address and DNS name to access a group of pods.
   
2. **Load Balancing**  
   - Distributes traffic across multiple pod replicas to ensure high availability.

3. **Service Discovery**  
   - Kubernetes automatically assigns a DNS name to each Service, making it easy for applications to find and communicate with each other.

4. **Decoupling**  
   - Services abstract the underlying pod instances, allowing pods to be replaced without breaking connectivity.

## **Types of Services**
Kubernetes supports different types of Services based on use cases:

1. **ClusterIP (Default)**
   - Exposes the Service inside the cluster only.
   - Used for internal communication between pods.
   - Example:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
     name: my-service
   spec:
     selector:
       app: my-app
     ports:
       - protocol: TCP
         port: 80
         targetPort: 8080
   ```

2. **NodePort**
   - Exposes the Service on a static port on each node.
   - Accessible externally via `<NodeIP>:<NodePort>`.
   - Example:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
     name: my-service
   spec:
     type: NodePort
     selector:
       app: my-app
     ports:
       - protocol: TCP
         port: 80
         targetPort: 8080
         nodePort: 30000
   ```

3. **LoadBalancer**
   - Uses a cloud providerâ€™s external load balancer to route traffic to the service.
   - Used for internet-facing applications.
   - Example:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
     name: my-service
   spec:
     type: LoadBalancer
     selector:
       app: my-app
     ports:
       - protocol: TCP
         port: 80
         targetPort: 8080
   ```

4. **ExternalName**
   - Maps a Kubernetes Service to an external DNS name.
   - Used for integrating with external services.
   - Example:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
     name: my-service
   spec:
     type: ExternalName
     externalName: example.com
   ```

---

## **Managing Services**
- **List Services:**  
  ```sh
  kubectl get services
  ```
- **Describe a Service:**  
  ```sh
  kubectl describe service my-service
  ```
- **Delete a Service:**  
  ```sh
  kubectl delete service my-service
  ```

---

## **Conclusion**
Services in Kubernetes provide a stable way to expose and manage access to applications running in pods. Whether for internal communication, external access, or load balancing, Kubernetes Services ensure reliable networking for containerized applications.
